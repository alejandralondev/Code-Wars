// Very simple, given an integer or a floating-point number, find its opposite.

function opposite(number) {
    return (number * -1)
  }
  //return is used to return a particular value from the function. 
  // The function will stop the execution when the return statement is called and return a specific value. 
  // The return statement should be the last statement of the function because the code after the return statement won't be accessible
  // by multiplying the number by a negative one we get the opposite, the numbers negative value
